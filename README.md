# Denoising Dirty Documents
#### Tiago de Miranda Leite, NUSP: 7595289

Old printed documents often have imperfections due to the passage of time or poor care. Thus, yellow or crumpled pages, faded letters and symbols, spots of liquids and fungi, among others, correspond to noise, which makes it hard to properly manipulate and use the digitized versions of those documents. The proposal of this project is to apply and compare some image restoration techniques, such as noise reduction filters and, as a deep learning approach, convolutional autoencoders, for the restoration of such documents as digitized images. Such images have been produced in a synthetic way, with noise added in order to simulate the mentioned imperfections. This project aims to contribute to the cleaning of such digitized documents, allowing their use in digital readers and facilitating the later application of techniques such as optical character recognition (OCR).
